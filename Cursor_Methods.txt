Cursor Methods

Thses 4 methods are called as cursor methods;

count()
limit()
skip()
sort()

db.products.find({price : {$gt : 250}}).limit(4).skip(1) --->>  Means give us 4 data according to the limit() but skip the first one due to the skip() and now shows the proceeding data   

db.products.find({price : {$gt : 250}}).limit(3).sort(price: 1)

sort:-
1 for ascending order
-1 for descending order

Use with Caution :- 

- Be cautious when using limit() and skip() on large collections
- Consider using indexing to optimize query performance
