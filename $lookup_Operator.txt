$lookup operator :- To join the collections in mongoDB

There are four joins in the database world.

1. Inner Join 
2. Left Outer Join
3. Right Outer Join
4. Full Outer Join

The $lookup is an aggregation pipeline that allows you to perform a left outer join betweeen two collections.

lookup is used to achieve the left-outer join

e.g. :-

db.cust.aggregate([{
    $lookup: {
        from: "orders" -->> Means that join the customer collection with orders collection 
        localField: id -->> In current collection(customer collection) is going to match from the id with join collection(orders)
        foreignField: c_id -->> "c_id" in the orders collection which will  matched with the customer collection "id"
        as: "OrderDetails" -->> Field new name will be set  
    }
}])

1. db.cust.aggregate([{$lookup: {from: "orders", localField: "_id", foreignField: "customer_id", as: "OrderDetails" }  }]).pretty()

2. db.cust.aggregate([{$lookup: {from: "orders", localField: "_id", foreignField: "customer_id", as: "OrderDetails"} }, {$match: {"OrderDetails": {$size: 1}} } ]).pretty()
