$or -->> If atleast any one of the following condition is true then the output is going to show  
$not
$nor

Syntax :- 
AND Operator >>
{$and: [{condition1}, {condition2}, ...]} -->> // Array of expressions
db.products.find({$and: [{"id": {$lt: "2140"}}, {"name": {$eq: "hasan"}}] }).


OR Operator >>
{$or: [{condition1}, {condition2}, ...]} -->> Atleast One condition is true to show something ; if all condition is false then the output will not shown
db.products.find({$or: [{"id": {$lt: "2140"}}, {"name": {$eq: "hasan"}}] }). // Array of expressions

NOT Operator >>
{field: {$not: {operator: value}}}
db.products.find({"id": {$not: {$gte: "2137"}} })

NOR Operator >> Means according to the condition leave all that data and show instead of remaining rest data which will not according to that condition
db.products.find({$nor: [{"id": {$lt: "2140"}}, {"name": {$eq: "hasan"}}] }). // Array of expressions

In mongoDB when you provide mulitple fields with in a single query documents, MongoDB treats them as an implicit AND operations
