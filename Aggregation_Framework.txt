************************** Aggregation Framework ********************************

Definition: Aggregation is the process of performing transformations on documents and combining them to produce computed results.
Aggregation is all about pipelines

Pipeline Stages: Aggregations consist of multiple pipeline stages, each performing a specific operation on the input data. 

Benefits :- 
✔ Aggregating Data: Complex calculations and operations are possible.
✔ Advanced Transformations: Data can be combined, reshaped, and computed for insights.
✔ Efficient Processing: Aggregation handles large datasets efficiently.


Aggregation Operation

$match
The $match stage is similar to the query used as the first argument in .find(). It filters documents based on specified conditions.

• Syntax
{$match: {<query> }}

You must remember that while using aggregation paranthesis, [] and then curly braces will be used ; Array of an Object

Example :-
db.products.aggregate([
{ $match: {company: "64c23350e32f4a51b19b9235"}} ])

1. db.products.aggregate([{$match: {"name": "hasan"} } ])
2. db.products.aggregate([{$match: {"id": {$gte: "2139" } } } ])
3.  db.products.aggregate([ {$match: {"commentCount": {$eq: '0' } } } ])
