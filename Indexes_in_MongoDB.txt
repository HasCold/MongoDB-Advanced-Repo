Indexes in MongoDB

What are Indexes?

- Indexes are specialized data structures that optimize data retrieval speed in MongoDB.
- Indexes store a fraction of data in a more searchable format.
- They enable MongoDB to locate data faster during queries.
- Indexes are separate from collections and multiple indexes can exist per collection.

Benefits of Indexes

- Faster Querying: Indexes drastically accelerate data retrieval, particularly for large collections.
- Efficient Sorting: Indexes facilitate rapid sorting based on specific fields.
- Improved Aggregation: Aggregation operations become more efficient with optimized indexes.
- Indexing on Multiple Fields: Complex queries can be executed efficiently by utilizing multiple fields in indexes.

Use explain() method to understand query execution in detail. 
so use the explain() like -->> db.products.find({id: {$gt: "2135" } }).explain()

db.products.find({id: {$gt: "2135" } }).explain("executionStats")
